## Organic Molecules in Star Formation Regions

Currently, I am working with Professor Rachel Friesen looking at long carbon chains in star forming regions. I am using a [machine learning package](https://github.com/jdhenshaw/acorns) to identify clusters of different organic molecules as seen below

**Future Plans**

I intend to use the plots of different molecules to calculate column density of the molecues in the gas cluster to determine the virial stability of the cluster.
