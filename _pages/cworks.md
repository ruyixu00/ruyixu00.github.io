## Organic Molecules in Star Formation Regions

Currently, I am working with Professor Rachel Friesen looking at long carbon chains in star forming regions. I am using a [machine learning package](https://github.com/jdhenshaw/acorns) to identify clusters of different organic molecules as seen below

Using these results together with Dust maps from the James Clark Maxwell Telescope and Carbon Monoxide maps from the Five College Radio Astronomical Observatory. We set out boundries of each cores using dust and then compute the virial parameters of each of these molecules and compare them to the abundance of the complex molecules. Initial analysis shows us that there are some positive relations between the stability of such cores and the abundance of complex molecules.

From the diagram we can clearly see that as observed intensities inceas Virial Parameter decreases indicating a more stable core.  </figcaption>

**Future Plans**
Future work include increasing the complexity of our modles by considering factors such as magnetic fields, rotational kinematics and probing into the chemistry of such regions.
