## Organic Molecules in Star Formation Regions

Currently, I am working with Professor Rachel Friesen looking at long carbon chains in star forming regions. I am using a [machine learning package](https://github.com/jdhenshaw/acorns) to identify clusters of different organic molecules as seen below

**Future Plans**

I intend to use the plots of different molecules along with their enthalpy values to estimate the energy density and temperature of different regions. Hopefully using this information and blackbody spectrum of the region we can have a better idea of the relative velocity of the star forming region.
