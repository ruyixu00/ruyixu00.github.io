Hello! Iâ€™m Ruyi, an Undergraduate at the University of Toronto majoring in Astronomy and Physics. I will graduate in June 2025 and be open to academic and professional opportunities.

Academically my interests lie in star formation regions' chemical and nuclear evolution and Solar Physics. I am open to trying new things and would love to learn more about other specialities. Outside of Academics, I am an avid trader boasting a 2nd place in my University's Trading competition in 2023. Other than this I am also particularly interested in Macroeconomic policies and modelling as well.

## Current Research & Works
Currently, I am working with Post Doctorate Fellow Dr. [Duo Xu](https://sites.google.com/view/xuduo) and Professor [Rachel Friesen](https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~friesen/) on determining the borders of different-sized carbon chain molecules in star-forming regions. I am also currently working with Professor [Roberto Abraham](https://www.robertoabraham.com/) on STARS ([Seestar](https://www.seestar.com/) Telescope ARrayS). We are currently exploring if multiple cheap and off the shelf telescopes can be made into an array to achieve research grade imagery in Inner City sky conditions. Outside of research I serving as the Treasurer of the [Physics Student Union](https://www.physu.org/home) where I plan budgets for the union and prepare reimbursements for other executives. I encourage all current and future students to actively participate in the Union's academic and social activities to meet similar-minded individuals and explore the vast fields of Physics.
