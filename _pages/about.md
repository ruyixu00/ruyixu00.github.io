Hello! Iâ€™m Ruyi, an Undergraduate at the University of Toronto majoring in Astronomy and Physics. I will graduate in June 2025 and be open to academic and professional opportunities.

Academically my interests lie in star formation regions' chemical and nuclear evolution and Solar Physics. I am open to trying new things and would love to learn more about other specialities. Outside of Academics, I am an avid trader boasting a 2nd place in my University's Trading competition in 2023. Other than this I am also particularly interested in Macroeconomic policies, data analysis, semiconductor fabrication instruments and modelling as well.

## Current Research & Works
Currently, I am working on 3 projects, 1 of them with Post Doctorate Fellow Dr. [Duo Xu](https://sites.google.com/view/xuduo) and Professor [Rachel Friesen](https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~friesen/) on determining the relationship between complex molecules and core stability of cores in star-forming regions. Another project I am working with Professor [Roberto Abraham](https://www.robertoabraham.com/) on STARS ([Seestar](https://www.seestar.com/) Telescope ARrayS). We are currently exploring if multiple cheap and off the shelf telescopes can be made into an array to achieve research grade imagery in Inner City sky conditions. Lastly, I am working with Professor [Michael Reid](https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~mreid/) on developing an exposure time calculator for the University's new half meter telescope at the E.C Carr Observatory. Outside of research I served as the Treasurer of the [Undergraduate Physics Student Union](https://www.physu.org/home) of University of Toronto where I plan budgets and some events for the union and prepare reimbursements for other executives. I encourage all current and future students to actively participate in the Union's academic and social activities to meet similar-minded individuals and explore the vast fields of Physics.
