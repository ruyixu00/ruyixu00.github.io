Hi! Iâ€™m Ruyi, an Undergraduate at the University of Toronto majoring in Astronomy and Physics. I will be graduating in June 2025 and will be open to both academic and professional opportunities.

Academically my interests lie in star formation regions' chemical and nuclear evolution and Solar Physics. I am open to trying new things and would love to learn more about other specialities. Outside of Academics, I am an avid trader boasting a 2nd place in my University's Trading competition in 2023. Other than this I am also particularly interested in Macroeconomic policies and modelling as well.
